        <h3>Welcome to EnguiMapCLI</h3>

<p>EnguiMapCLI was created as the result of a partnership between EnguiSoft and Kraig Beahn, CEO at L2Networks Corp.</p>

<p>EnguiMapCLI provides basic CLI style IP MTU testing, estimating the default internet transit providers maximum transport unit, while also providing standard network adapter information, including the hardware (mac-address), assigned IPv4 address, gateway status and round trip time in a convenient, yet compact and easy to read format.</p>

<p>Written in both Pure C, AutoIT v3 and wrapped into a single, portable executable for easy transfer and use.</p>

<p>This tool is being provided to the global Information Technology community, in hopes that it may be useful in streamlining local network support and in turn spurring a more detailed knowledge of how Layer-2 and Layer-3 technology functions, at a more advanced, enterprise level.</p>
